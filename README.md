This is a Machine Learning Project. 
In this project Face Recognition is used to detect and mark the attendance of students.

This is designed to be used by the Teacher.

The Faces are detected by the ML model and the corresponding name is then marked and the file is saved in a .csv file.

The Front End is made using Electron which combines JavaScript, HTML , CSS.
The Backend and Machine Learning is done with python.

ML model is trained by taking photos of the student and analyzing them.

Fisher Model is used as ML algorithm of choice here.
